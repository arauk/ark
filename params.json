{"name":"Atlas Android","tagline":"Android Framework by Atlas Technology","body":"## Welcome to AtlasAndroid\r\n\r\nAtlasAndroid is a modern framework that includes everything needed to create\r\ndatabase-backed Android applications according to the\r\n[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)\r\npattern. The initial version of the framework is entirely focused on the model\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding AtlasAndroid. MVC divides\r\nyour application into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe _Model layer_ represents your domain model (such as Account, Product,\r\nPerson, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to your\r\napplication. In AtlasAndroid, database-backed model classes are derived from\r\n`ActiveRecord` class. Active Record allows you to present the data from database\r\nrows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods.\r\nAlthough most AtlasAndroid models are backed by a database, models can also be\r\nordinary Java classes, or Java classes that implement a set of interfaces as\r\nprovided by the Active Model module. You can read more about ActiveRecord in its\r\n[README](activerecord/README.md).\r\n\r\nActiveRecord, and ActionRequest can each be used independently outside\r\nAtlasAndroid. In addition to them, AtlasAndroid also comes with ActiveSupport\r\n([README](activesupport/README.md)), a collection of utility classes and\r\nstandard library extensions that are useful for AtlasAndroid, and may also be\r\nused independently outside the framework.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to contribute to all of our frameworks!
